# 🏀 Basketball Video Analysis

Analyze basketball footage with automated detection of players, ball, team assignment, and more. This repository integrates object tracking, zero-shot classification, and custom keypoint detection for a fully annotated basketball game experience.

Leveraging the convenience of Roboflow for dataset management and Ultralytics' YOLO models for both training and inference, this project provides a robust framework for basketball video analysis.

Training notebooks are included to help you customize and fine-tune models to suit your specific needs, ensuring a seamless and efficient workflow.

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. **Install the required packages**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🎓 Training the Models

Harnessing the powerful tools offered by Roboflow and Ultralytics makes it straightforward to manage datasets, handle annotations, and train advanced object detection models. Roboflow provides an intuitive platform for dataset preprocessing and augmentation, while Ultralytics’ YOLO architectures (v5, v8, and beyond) deliver state-of-the-art detection performance.

This repository relies on trained models for detecting basketballs, players, and court keypoints. You have two options to get these models:

1. Download the Pretrained Weights

   - ball_detector_model.pt  
     (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KejdrcEnto2AKjdgdo1U1syr5gODp6EL/view?usp=sharing)
   - court_keypoint_detector.pt  
     (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nGoG-pUkSg4bWAUIeQ8aN6n7O1fOkXU0/view?usp=sharing)
   - player_detector.pt  
     (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fVBLZtPy9Yu6Tf186oS4siotkioHBLHy/view?usp=sharing)

   Simply download these files and place them into the `models/` folder in your project. This allows you to run the pipelines without manually retraining.

2. Train Your Own Models  
   The training scripts are provided in the `training_notebooks/` folder. These Jupyter notebooks use Roboflow datasets and the Ultralytics YOLO frameworks to train various detection tasks:

   - `basketball_ball_training.ipynb`: Trains a basketball ball detector (using YOLOv5). Incorporates motion blur augmentations to improve ball detection accuracy on fast-moving game footage.
   - `basketball_court_keypoint_training.ipynb`: Uses YOLOv8 to detect keypoints on the court (e.g., lines, corners, key zones).
   - `basketball_player_detection_training.ipynb`: Trains a player detection model (using YOLO v11) to identify players in each frame.

   You can easily run these notebooks in Google Colab or another environment with GPU access. After training, download the newly generated `.pt` files and place them in the `models/` folder.

## Once you have your models in place, you may proceed with the usage steps described above. If you want to retrain or fine-tune for your specific dataset, remember to adjust the paths in the notebooks and in `main.py` to point to the newly generated models.

## 🚀 Usage

The application supports both local video files and YouTube videos, with optional timestamp ranges.

### Basic Usage

**Analyze local video file:**
```bash
python3 main.py --file input_videos/game.mp4
```

**Analyze YouTube video:**
```bash
python3 main.py --youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"
```

### Advanced Usage with Timestamps

**Analyze specific segment of local video (2:00 to 5:30):**
```bash
python3 main.py --file input_videos/game.mp4 --start-time 2:00 --end-time 5:30
```

**Analyze YouTube video segment:**
```bash
python3 main.py --youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" --start-time 1:30 --end-time 4:00
```

**Keep downloaded YouTube video:**
```bash
python3 main.py --youtube "URL" --keep-youtube
```

### All Options

- `--file PATH`: Path to local video file
- `--youtube URL`: YouTube video URL (mutually exclusive with --file)
- `--start-time TIME`: Start time (formats: `HH:MM:SS`, `MM:SS`, or seconds)
- `--end-time TIME`: End time (formats: `HH:MM:SS`, `MM:SS`, or seconds)
- `--output_video PATH`: Custom output path (default: auto-generated)
- `--stub_path PATH`: Stub directory for caching (default: `stubs/`)
- `--keep-youtube`: Keep downloaded YouTube video after processing

### Notes

- **Timestamps** work for both local files and YouTube videos
- **YouTube downloads** are automatically deleted after processing unless `--keep-youtube` is specified
- **Stubs** (cached intermediate results) speed up repeated analysis
- **Output naming** is automatic based on video title

## 🏰 Project Structure

- `main.py`  
  – Orchestrates the entire pipeline: reading video frames, running detection/tracking, team assignment, drawing results, and saving the output video.

- `trackers/`  
  – Houses `PlayerTracker` and `BallTracker`, which use detection models to generate bounding boxes and track objects across frames.

- `utils/`  
  – Contains helper functions like `bbox_utils.py` for geometric calculations, `stubs_utils.py` for reading and saving intermediate results, and `video_utils.py` for reading/saving videos.

- `drawers/`  
  – Contains classes that overlay bounding boxes, court lines, passes, etc., onto frames.

- `ball_aquisition/`  
  – Logic for identifying which player is in possession of the ball.

- `pass_and_interception_detector/`  
  – Identifies passing events and interceptions.

- `court_keypoint_detector/`  
  – Detects lines and keypoints on the court using the specified model.

- `team_assigner/`  
  – Uses zero-shot classification (Hugging Face or similar) to assign players to teams based on jersey color.

- `configs/`  
  – Holds default paths for models, stubs, and output video.

## 🔮 Future Work

As we continue to enhance the capabilities of this basketball video analysis tool, several areas for future development have been identified:

1. **Integrating a Pose Model for Advanced Rule Detection**  
   Incorporating a pose detection model could enable the identification of complex basketball rules such as double dribbling and traveling. By analyzing player movements and positions, the system could automatically flag these infractions, adding another layer of analysis to the video footage.

These enhancements will further refine the analysis capabilities and provide users with more comprehensive insights into basketball games.
